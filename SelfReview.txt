After receiving the code from our providers and trying to adapt our code to work with theirs,
we realised that some of the functionality that we had built in to our implementation to try and be more flexible,
actually made it more difficult to integrate with the code from our providers. This was because the functionality we had built in
was not necessary for our view to function and did not need to be something that we abstracted out.
The main example of this in our code was that we implemented a way to set the hotkey for the features of the view.
This was unnecessary and had to be removed in order to integrate with the code from our providers.
Fortunately, this did not create any issues for our customers and just required a bit of explanation.

Our overall experience with our providers was fine. We had a few issues with communication in the middle of the project,
with some of the changes we had requested, but that was resolved peacefully and we were able to continue working with them.
They were able implement the main changes that we requested, which were necessary to integrate with their code.
But not some of the bugs in their view, which we just had to live with.
